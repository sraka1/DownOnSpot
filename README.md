## Building

Clone the repository using git and change to the local repository directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oSumAtrIX/DownOnSpot.git
cd DownOnSpot
```

A [private ssh key](https://osumatrix.me/ucp?get=free_librespot_private_key&token=fdfdbff6f5) is needed to use free Spotify accounts. 
Follow [this answer by DopeGhoti on stackexchange.com](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/494485) on how to set up ssh with the required private key.
A sample `~/.ssh/config` file could look like this:

```text
Host github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/free_librespot_private_key
```

If you do not want to use `free-librespot` (i.e. if you are using a paid Spotify account), then remove the git dependency of `free-librespot`. 
For that, delete `git = "ssh://git@github.com/oSumAtrIX/free-librespot.git"` inside `Cargo.toml`.
For paid Spotify accounts, make sure to then add `librespot = "0.3.1"` in the `Cargo.toml` file instead.

`Nightly Rust` is required to build this project. Install it by following [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs) instructions.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

If you get a linker error, you might need to download the [standard libmp3lame](https://www.rarewares.org/mp3-lame-libraries.php#libmp3lame) library.
On OS X, it should be enough to just run `brew install lame`, provided you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.

## Usage/ Examples

Running DownOnSpot once will create the default configuration file in the same directory as your shell.

```bash
$ down_on_spot.exe
Settings could not be loaded, because of the following error: IO: NotFound No such file or directory. (os error 2)...
..but default settings have been created successfully. Edit them and run the program again.

$ down_on_spot.exe
Usage:
down_on_spot.exe (search_term | track_url | album_url | playlist_url | artist_url)
```
On OS X, the `settings.json` file is created globally for the logged in user and is located in `~/.config/down_on_spot/settings.json`.

Apart from your Spotify username and password, you will need to login in to the Spotify developer dashboard and [create a new private application](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications). Fill in the `client_id` and `client_secret` in your `settings.json` from your newly created app.
All the other settings should be self-explanatory, conversion from Ogg to MP3 is disabled by default.

### Template variables

Following variables are available for `path` and `filename_template` in the `settings.json`:

-   %0disc%
-   %0track%
-   %album%
-   %albumArtist%
-   %albumArtists%
-   %artist%
-   %disc%
-   %id%
-   %title%
-   %track%

## Additional scripts

## Known issues

-   Downloads fail sometimes due to `channel error`
